        <h2>Community and Environmental Impact</h2>
        <p>Our project addresses the urgent issues of coastal erosion and plastic pollution in Ghana's coastal regions, exacerbated by climate change and improper waste management. By integrating biotechnological solutions, we aim to not only clean up these environments but also reinforce them against future damage.</p>
        
        <h2>Stakeholder Engagement</h2>
        <p>We engage with local communities, environmental experts, and policymakers to ensure our approach is holistic and sustainable. Our initiatives are geared towards creating durable solutions while educating and empowering local populations about sustainable practices.</p>
        
        <h2>Ethical Considerations and Sustainability</h2>
        <p>Our solution utilizes environmentally friendly methods to decompose plastic waste and use the byproducts to help prevent coastal erosion. This approach not only cleans the environment but also provides a sustainable way to protect vital coastal lands against future erosion.</p>
